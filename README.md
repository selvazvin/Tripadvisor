ðŸŽ‰ Excited to Share My Latest Web Development Project!
ðŸš€ I recently challenged myself to recreate a responsive TripAdvisor home screen using just HTML and CSS, and Iâ€™m thrilled with how it turned out!
ðŸ’» Key Highlights of the Project:
âœ… Fully responsive design across devices.
âœ… Clean and structured code for easy scalability.
âœ… Focused on maintaining the brand's core aesthetic while improving usability.
As a UI/UX designer, I always strive to blend creativity and functionality to craft seamless user experiences. This project was a great way to push my boundaries and enhance my skills!
Iâ€™d love to hear your feedbackâ€”what do you think of the design? Letâ€™s connect and share ideas! ðŸŒŸ
